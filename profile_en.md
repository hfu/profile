HIDENORI FUJIMURA

Director, Information Access Division

Geospatial Information Authority of Japan
 
Director of a division of the National Geospatial Information Authority of Japan, a national organization that conducts basic survey and mapping and instructs related organizations to clarify the conditions of land in Japan and that provides the results of surveys to promote the application of geospatial information, including further survey and mapping in municipal level.
 
His division has been operating a tile-based web map site titled “GSI Maps” (http://maps.gsi.go.jp/) since 2003. GSI Maps has been providing topographic maps, orthophotos, control point information, thematic maps so on, as GSI Tiles, open data in line with the open data strategy of the Government of Japan.
GSI Maps are also used to share disaster information, such as conditions of land after and before disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, landslides, flood, volcano eruptions and so on, and are used for disaster relief. These days he is especially interested in vector tiles and open innovation, to increase the societal value of the service he is engaged in.
 
Hidenori received his Master’s degree in Mathematical Engineering and Information Physics from the University of Tokyo.
